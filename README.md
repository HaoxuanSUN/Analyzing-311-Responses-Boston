## Project Overview - Team 1

### Motivation

We want to find if there is a pattern between areas that report 311 calls and have them responded to, and the demographics of those regions.


### Goal

Analyze patterns in 311 requests, geography, and various demographics in order to see who feels empowered to make the requests and if they have been responded to equitably.


### Background

Using 311 and Social Vulnerability Index datasets, we want to study the relationships between vulnerable populations and their requests.


## Navigating the repo

All the code is located in the `code` folder in the top level directory. Input data is omitted, but instructions are give in the Jupyter notebooks on how to download this data and store it into the `data` folder. Outputs are stored in the `output` folder and they are pushed to git for easy access.
